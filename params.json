{"name":"Structures & Algorithms","tagline":"Lab solutions","body":"### Welcome to the Structures & Algorithms GitHub Repository\r\nThis repository is a working copy of my solutions to the Structures & Algorithms labs. I have released my work to the public domain and you may use it however you choose. I do however make a polite request: please do not directly copy my code, use it for the basis of your own work. I do not guarantee that this code works, fits the solution, or even compiles, but it is an up-to-date copy of what I have done so far. I try to keep this repo as up to date as I can with the latest labs, but I may be a bit behind if there's new labs to do, check back in a few days if there's not a solution up yet.\r\n\r\n### Downloading as a zip\r\nYou can download all of my code so far as a zip (or .tar.gz if that's your thing) from the link at the top right. (Or you can just click here!)[https://github.com/chartax/structures-and-algorithms/zipball/master]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Previewing code online\r\nYou can preview my code on [GitHub directly.](https://github.com/chartax/structures-and-algorithms)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checking out code from GitHub\r\n\r\nYou can check out my code using the [git client] (http://git-scm.com) with the following code in the command prompt:\r\n\r\n```batch\r\n> cd %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\r\n> git clone https://github.com/chartax/structures-and-algorithms\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using a Git GUI client, you can also check out the code through that, or even through Eclipse (or another Java IDE) using a plugin.\r\n\r\n### Want to comment or add another solution?\r\nGo ahead and do the work and send me a pull request on GitHub (@Chartax), or [send me an email](mailto:alastair.campbell@outlook.com) about it, or talk to me in class and I'm sure we can get the code up here.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nAs I said before, I can't guarantee that this code will work, but if you need help understanding what I've done or why it's not working for you, you can absolutely [email me](mailto:alastair.campbell@outlook.com) or talk to me in class.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
